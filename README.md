# Social-Network-API

## Description

I created a social network API. When I give the command npm start it starts my application, once the server starts I can now test my data in Insomnia. Ocnce I am in Insomnia I am able to GET all users, GET all thoughts, GET a single thought, POST a user, POST a thought, PUT a user, and DELETE a user.
